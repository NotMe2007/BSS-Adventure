# BSS-Adventure

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: 95 %+ of all scripts are based on or copied from NatroMacro.

All contributions are welcome (as you can see, I'm doing it in Python, Ruff coding, as I am not that good, mainly focusing on the template, it's easier to add, fix, and continue building) 
If you have some friends who know a bit of code and have some ideas about how stuff works, do what u can, send code and add:D
---
This project was created because NatroMacro does not update fast enough, and it lacks some more useful features I wanted to include. BSS-Adventure aims to deliver quicker updates and add additional functionality for an enhanced experience.

Updates here will include
- Auto hatch a new bee when you have an empty slot
- Auto get specific gear, e.g, (gummy boots, coconut belt)
- Auto get Daemon/fire mask when doing an ant challenge, mondo, mondo chick, black bear, stump snail
- Auto-equip the honey mask when converting the bag
- Auto farm a new account 
- Auto stick bug
- Auto windy (if possible)
